# tankgame - Unfinished pygame project by @igafshell

A promising but unfinished side project I built 2 yrs ago.

## Features

- Main menu
- Skin menu (unfinished) - multiple skins
- Pause menu (unfinished) - darken screen effect, worked quite a bit on this one
- Map menu (unfinished) - multiple maps
- Dirt traces after players (this was a pretty hard one)
- Objects and ricochet missle (the implementation is wrong but the idea is there)
- Spaghetti code(it's kinda old)

## Controls

awsd - movement player one

arrow keys - movement player two

shift - shoot

esc - toggle pause in game

## Run

`python main.py`
